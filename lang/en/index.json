    "text": "Since 2005, AIMA Developpement has been designing, building, and testing innovative cyclotron designs for medical and industrial applications. Its expertise comes from the laboratory of the Antoine Lacassagne Center (CAL), which designed and built the MEDICYC cyclotron, the first French accelerator for proton therapy in a hospital. In 1999, Pierre Mandrillon, the project leader of MEDICYC, founded AIMA Company, of which he is still the CEO.",
