    "text": "In order to characterize and optimize innovative injection layouts, AIMA has built up an injection test bench. This bench is based on a large gap magnet (pole diameter 750 mm) with an axial bore allowing testing of both horizontal and axial devices. It allows testing of both internal PIG types sources and bigger (ECR or multicusp) external sources.",
